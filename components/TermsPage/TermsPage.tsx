              available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. A party who wishes to start
              arbitration must submit a written Demand for Arbitration to AAA and give notice to the
              other party as specified in the AAA Rules. The AAA provides a form Demand for
              Arbitration at www.adr.org. Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or
              parish) where you live, unless we both agree to a different location. The parties
              agree that the arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to decide all issues relating

              and costs and won’t seek to recover them from you. If you prevail in arbitration you
              will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses to the extent provided

              by either party and may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the

              generally, provided that the third party website or application cryptographically
              verifies each Cre8or owner’s rights to display the Art for their Cre8or to ensure that
              only the actual owner can display the Art, and provided that the Art is no longer
              visible once the owner of the Purchased Cre8or leaves the website/application; or
